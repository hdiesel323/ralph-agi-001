## The Problem

AI coding assistants are brilliant... for about 5 minutes.

Then they forget everything. Lose context. Start hallucinating. You're back to square one.

**Current AI limitations:**
- 🧠 **No persistent memory** - Every conversation starts from zero
- ⏱️ **Context window limits** - Long tasks get truncated
- 🎯 **No task completion awareness** - Doesn't know when it's actually done
- 🔄 **No learning** - Makes the same mistakes repeatedly
- 👀 **Requires constant supervision** - Can't run autonomously

**What if an AI could:**
- Work on complex tasks for hours (or days) without losing track
- Remember what it learned yesterday, last week, last month
- Know when it's genuinely done vs. when it's stuck
- Learn from mistakes and improve over time
- Run autonomously while you sleep (AFK Mode)

That's RALPH-AGI.

---

## The Approach

Most AI agent frameworks are overengineered. Complex orchestration, state machines, planning systems, agent hierarchies...

RALPH-AGI takes a radically simple approach inspired by the best open-source agent systems:

**The "Ralph Wiggum Pattern"** - Start simple, keep trying, get smarter.

```python
while not complete and under_budget:
    context = load_memory()
    result = execute_task_with_retry(context)

    if task_complete(result):
        celebrate()
        break

    save_to_memory(result)
    learn_from_result(result)
```

> *"Same energy as Ralph Wiggum eating glue... but with memory that actually works and self-improves so it eventually stops eating glue and starts building real stuff."*

### Core Principles

| Principle | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Simple Loop > Complex Orchestration** | A while loop beats fancy agent frameworks |
| **Persistent Memory** | Context survives across sessions |
| **Completion Detection** | Knows when to stop (and when to keep going) |
| **Graceful Failure** | Retries with exponential backoff, learns from errors |
| **Human-in-the-Loop Option** | AFK mode OR supervised mode |

---

## Current Status: Week 1 of 12

**Building this 100% in public.** Every win. Every failure. Every 3am debugging session.

### Sprint 1 Progress: 33% Complete

| Story | Points | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|--------|-------------|
| 1.1 Basic Loop | 3 | ✅ Done | Core RalphLoop execution engine |
| 1.2 Completion Detection | 2 | 🔜 Next | Promise-based completion signals |
| 1.3 Configuration | 2 | 📋 Planned | YAML-driven behavior |
| 1.4 AFK Mode | 2 | 📋 Planned | Autonomous operation mode |

### What's Working Now

```
✅ RalphLoop engine with configurable iterations
✅ IterationResult dataclass for rich output
✅ Exponential backoff retry logic (1s → 2s → 4s)
✅ Completion signal detection (<promise>COMPLETE</promise>)
✅ MaxRetriesExceeded with full error context
✅ ISO timestamp logging [YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS]
✅ Resource cleanup via close() method
✅ 33 unit tests passing
✅ 99% code coverage
```

## The 12-Week Roadmap

| Phase | Weeks | Epic | Goal |
|-------|-------|------|------|
| **1. Core Loop** | 1-2 | `epic-01` | Basic execution engine + completion detection |
| **2. Task Management** | 3-4 | `epic-02` | Beads integration, priorities, dependencies |
| **3. Memory System** | 5-6 | `epic-03` | Persistent context, semantic search, learning |
| **4. Tool Integration** | 7-8 | `epic-04` | File ops, git, testing, external APIs |
| **5. Evaluation Pipeline** | 9-10 | `epic-05` | Self-verification, quality gates, metrics |
| **6. Polish & Ship** | 11-12 | - | CLI, documentation, real-world testing |

### Success Metrics

- **Autonomous Task Completion:** 80%+ success rate on SWE-bench-lite
- **Context Retention:** Maintain coherent context over 100+ iterations
- **Self-Recovery:** 90%+ recovery from common errors without human intervention
- **Cost Efficiency:** <$5 average cost per completed task

## FAQ

**Q: Why "Ralph Wiggum"?**
A: The pattern is named after the Simpsons character who famously eats paste. The idea is that the agent starts simple (even dumb), but unlike Ralph, it actually learns and improves over time.

**Q: How is this different from AutoGPT, BabyAGI, etc.?**
A: Those projects focus on complex planning and agent hierarchies. RALPH-AGI focuses on a simple, robust execution loop with persistent memory. Less magic, more reliability.

**Q: When will it be ready to use?**
A: Follow the 12-week build. MVP targeting Week 6 (basic CLI), production-ready by Week 12.

**Q: Can I use this for my company?**
A: Yes! The MPL 2.0 license allows commercial use. For managed hosting and enterprise features, stay tuned for the Enterprise Edition.
