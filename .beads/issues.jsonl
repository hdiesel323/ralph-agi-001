An autonomous agent pushing directly to main is dangerous.\n\n## Requirements\n1. RALPH should create feature branches before making changes\n2. RALPH should push branches and create PRs (not push to main)\n3. RALPH should wait for CI/approval before merging (or flag for human review)\n4. Config option to control strictness (solo dev vs team workflow)\n\n## Implementation Ideas\n- Add `git_workflow` config: `direct` | `branch` | `pr`\n- Add GitTools: `create_branch()`, `push_branch()`, `create_pr()`\n- Builder prompt should instruct proper workflow\n- Verification layer should reject direct-to-main commits\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] RALPH creates feature branch before code changes\n- [ ] RALPH pushes branch and creates PR\n- [ ] RALPH never pushes directly to protected branches\n- [ ] Configurable workflow modes","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-13T21:49:40.994783-08:00","created_by":"admin","updated_at":"2026-01-13T22:59:48.433712-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-13T22:59:48.433712-08:00","close_reason":"Implemented in PR #11"}
