# RALPH-AGI Build-in-Public Announcement Tweet

## Main Tweet (280 characters max)

```
🚀 Building RALPH-AGI: An autonomous AI agent that codes while you sleep

Built on Anthropic's official guidance + 8 battle-tested open-source patterns

Following along? I'll share:
• Architecture decisions
• Code snippets
• Wins & failures
• Cost breakdowns

🧵👇
```

## Thread (Optional Follow-ups)

### Tweet 2: The Problem
```
The problem: Claude Code loses context on compaction. Complex tasks need human babysitting. Agents can't learn from past sessions.

The solution: A system that "compounds, doesn't compact" 

Memory persists. Learnings accumulate. Progress is unstoppable.
```

### Tweet 3: The Vision
```
Imagine:
• Giving Claude a task Friday night
• Waking up Monday to 50+ commits
• All tests passing
• Production-ready code
• Cost: $50 (not $5000)

That's the vision. Ralph Wiggum proved it's possible ($50k contract for $297 in API costs)
```

### Tweet 4: The Architecture
```
Core components:
🔄 Ralph Loop - Simple while loop, persistence wins
🧠 Memory System - SQLite + Chroma + Git history
📋 Beads - Dependency-aware task management
🪝 Hooks - 30+ automatic behaviors
🤖 Specialized Agents - Domain experts
📊 95% token savings via TLDR code analysis
```

### Tweet 5: Build-in-Public Commitment
```
I'm building this in public. Every week I'll share:

Week 1: PoC - Basic loop + stop hook
Week 2-3: Foundation - Beads + hooks
Week 4-5: Memory layer
Week 6: Token efficiency (TLDR)
Week 7-8: Multi-agent coordination
Week 9-12: Production deployment

Follow along! 🚀
```

### Tweet 6: The Research
```
Standing on the shoulders of giants:

✅ Anthropic Official Guidance (Nov 2025)
✅ Ralph Wiggum ($50k for $297)
✅ AI-Long-Task (AlphaEvolve-inspired)
✅ Continuous-Claude-v3 (2k⭐)
✅ Ralph Wiggum Marketer (276⭐)
✅ Beads (9.4k⭐)
✅ Claude-Mem (12.9k⭐)
✅ MCP-CLI

Synthesis > reinvention

## Alternative: Story-Driven

```
Last week I analyzed 8 autonomous agent systems:
• Ralph Wiggum ($50k for $297)
• AI-Long-Task (AlphaEvolve-inspired)
• Continuous-Claude-v3 (2k⭐)
• Anthropic harnesses
• Beads, Claude-Mem, MCP-CLI

Today I start building RALPH-AGI - combining the best of all

## Alternative: Problem-Solution

```
Problem: AI agents lose context, can't learn, need constant supervision

Solution: RALPH-AGI
• Memory that compounds across sessions
• Simple loops with strong feedback
• 95% token savings
• Ships code while you sleep

Building in public. Week 1 starts now 🚀

## Media Suggestions

### Option 1: Architecture Diagram
Create a simple visual showing:
```
User Request → Ralph Loop → Memory System → Specialized Agents → Production Code
```

### Option 2: Before/After Comparison
```
Before: Manual coding, context loss, repetitive work
After: Autonomous agent, persistent memory, compound learning
```

### Option 3: Progress Tracker
```
Week 1: PoC ⏳
Week 2-3: Foundation ⬜
Week 4-5: Memory ⬜
Week 6: Efficiency ⬜
Week 7-8: Agents ⬜
Week 9-12: Production ⬜
```

### Option 4: Stats Visual
```
📊 RALPH-AGI by the numbers:
• 8 reference implementations analyzed
• 109 skills (from Continuous-Claude)
• 32 specialized agents
• 30+ lifecycle hooks
• 95% token savings
• 12-week timeline
```

## Engagement Tactics

1. **Pin the thread** to your profile during the build
2. **Weekly updates** every Monday with progress
3. **Ask questions** to encourage replies ("What would you build with autonomous agents?")
4. **Share failures** not just wins (authenticity drives engagement)
5. **Tag relevant accounts** (@AnthropicAI when mentioning Claude, etc.)
6. **Use polls** ("Which feature should I prioritize? A) Memory B) Multi-agent C) Token efficiency")
7. **Share code snippets** with syntax highlighting
8. **Create comparison threads** (RALPH-AGI vs other approaches)
9. **Celebrate milestones** (First autonomous commit! First 24-hour run! etc.)
10. **Invite collaboration** ("Who wants to test the alpha?")
