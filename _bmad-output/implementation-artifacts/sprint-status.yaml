    goal: |
      Build a working Proof of Concept demonstrating the Ralph Wiggum loop
      processing 3-5 simple coding tasks autonomously.

    success_criteria:
      - Basic loop executes without errors
      - Completion detection working
      - Configuration loaded from YAML
      - Progress logged to file
      - Handles errors gracefully

    notes: |
      Focus on validating the core loop concept before adding complexity.
      Use mock LLM responses for initial testing.
      Real LLM integration can be added once loop is stable.
