# RALPH-AGI Build-in-Public: The Complete Twitter SOP

**Objective:** To create a viral, engaging, and community-driven build-in-public campaign for RALPH-AGI on Twitter, culminating in a successful launch and a strong, supportive community.

This SOP is based on analysis of 9 autonomous agent systems (including Anthropic's official engineering guidance), 7 top build-in-public founders, viral thread patterns from 5 masterclass guides, and best practices from the #buildinpublic community (234.2K members).

## Phase 1: Pre-Launch (Weeks 1-2)

### 1.1. Profile Optimization

- **Bio:** "Building RALPH-AGI in public. AGI-like intelligence for autonomous software development. Follow my 12-week journey from idea to launch. #buildinpublic #AI #AGI"
- **Header Image:** Professional graphic with RALPH-AGI logo, tagline, and key features (e.g., "Autonomous Development," "Persistent Memory," "Self-Verification").
- **Pinned Tweet:** The announcement thread (see below).

### 1.2. Content Strategy

- **Posting Frequency:** 3-5 tweets/day, 1 thread/week.
- **Best Times to Post:** 10 AM - 5 PM, Tuesday-Thursday.
- **Content Pillars:**
  - **Progress Updates (40%):** Daily wins, challenges, code snippets, architecture diagrams.
  - **Educational Content (30%):** Insights from your research, explanations of AGI concepts, quick tips on AI development.
  - **Behind-the-Scenes (20%):** Your workspace, tools you use, personal reflections.
  - **Community Engagement (10%):** Polls, questions, shoutouts to other builders.

### 1.3. Announcement Thread (Launch Day of Build-in-Public)

**Hook (Tweet 1):**

> Last week I analyzed 9 autonomous agent systems:
> • Anthropic Official Guidance (Nov 2025)
> • Ralph Wiggum ($50k for $297)
> • AI-Long-Task (AlphaEvolve-inspired)
> • Continuous-Claude-v3 (2k⭐)
> • Ralph Wiggum Marketer (marketing automation)
> • Beads (9.4k⭐), Claude-Mem (12.9k⭐), MCP-CLI
>
> Today I start building RALPH-AGI - combining the best of all
>
> 12-week build-in-public 🧵
> 
> github.com/hdiesel323/ralph-agi-001

**Thread Content (Tweets 2-7):**

1.  **The Problem:** "The biggest challenge in autonomous agents? Context loss and no long-term memory. They're brilliant but forgetful. RALPH-AGI solves this."
2.  **The Vision:** "Imagine an AI that can code for days, remember every conversation, and learn from its mistakes. That's RALPH-AGI. Code while you sleep."
3.  **The Architecture:** "The secret sauce? A simple loop (Ralph Wiggum) + persistent memory (Claude-Mem) + automatic behaviors (Continuous-Claude-v3 hooks). Here's a diagram..."
4.  **Build-in-Public Commitment:** "I'm building RALPH-AGI in public for the next 12 weeks. Expect weekly updates, transparent metrics, and all the wins and fails."
5.  **The Research:** "I'm standing on the shoulders of giants. Huge thanks to the creators of these amazing open-source projects. This is what building in public is all about."
6.  **Call to Action:** "Follow along for the journey! Star the repo on GitHub, join the conversation, and let's build the future of autonomous agents together. #buildinpublic #AI #AGI"

## Phase 2: The 12-Week Build

### 2.1. Weekly Content Calendar

| Day       | Content Type          | Example                                                                                             |
| :-------- | :-------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Monday**  | **Weekly Goals**      | "This week's goal for RALPH-AGI: Implement the Beads dependency-aware task system. Here's the plan..."   |
| **Tuesday** | **Technical Deep Dive** | **Thread:** "How RALPH-AGI uses a 5-layer code analysis (AST → CFG) to achieve 95% token savings..." |
| **Wednesday**| **Progress Update**     | **Video/GIF:** "First successful run of the new memory compaction module! Here's how it works..."       |
| **Thursday**| **Challenge/Failure**   | "Hit a major roadblock with the multi-agent coordination. The SQLite approach is causing deadlocks. Back to the drawing board..." |
| **Friday**  | **Weekly Recap & Q&A**| "Week 3 of #buildinpublic done! ✅ Beads integrated, ❌ multi-agent coordination needs rethink. What should I try next?" |
| **Saturday**| **Educational Content** | "What's the difference between the Zeigarnik Effect and Information Gap Theory? Here's how I use both to write viral threads..." |
| **Sunday**  | **Reflection/Planning** | "Planning week 4 of the RALPH-AGI build. Thinking of tackling the hooks system from Continuous-Claude-v3. Any tips?" |

### 2.2. Engagement Strategy

- **Respond to all comments** within 24 hours.
- **Ask questions** in your tweets to encourage replies.
- **Run weekly polls** on feature prioritization or design choices.
- **Host Twitter Spaces** every 2 weeks with other AI builders.
- **Give shoutouts** to people who provide valuable feedback or contribute to the repo.

### 2.3. Visuals are Key

- **Code Snippets:** Use a tool like Carbon (carbon.now.sh) to create beautiful code images.
- **Architecture Diagrams:** Create clean, easy-to-understand diagrams (I can help with this).
- **GIFs/Screen Recordings:** Use a tool like Kap or Giphy Capture to show the agent in action.
- **Progress Bars:** Create simple visuals to show progress towards the 12-week goal.

## Key Takeaways from Viral Accounts

- **Authenticity over Perfection:** Share the messy middle, not just the polished end result.
- **Consistency is King:** A consistent posting schedule builds anticipation and trust.
- **Community is Everything:** Your community is your biggest asset. Nurture it.
- **Visuals Amplify Reach:** A good visual can 10x the engagement of a text-only tweet.
- **Storytelling Sells:** People connect with stories, not just features.

By following this SOP, you'll not only build a powerful AGI agent but also a thriving community of supporters, customers, and collaborators. Let's do this!
