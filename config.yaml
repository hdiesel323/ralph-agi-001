# This file configures the Ralph Loop Engine behavior.
# All values have sensible defaults - only override what you need.

# Maximum iterations before forced exit
# Set to 0 to disable (not recommended)
max_iterations: 100

# String that signals task completion
# When detected in LLM output, the loop exits successfully
completion_promise: "<promise>COMPLETE</promise>"

# Iterations between state checkpoints
# Lower = more frequent saves, higher = better performance
checkpoint_interval: 1

# Retry configuration for failed iterations
max_retries: 3
retry_delays: [1, 2, 4]  # Exponential backoff in seconds

# Optional: Log file path (logs to console only if not set)
